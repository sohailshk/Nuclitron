The source for this CME is uncertain, and possibly the strangest signature I've witnessed in SOHO. At 2024-04-26T13:25Z in SOHO LASCO C2's FOV, an area of empty space in the SW portion of the image seemingly ""splits"" apart, with one loop falling back to the disk and the other projecting out as the analyzed front. Since the front is not visible emerging from the disk and rather as described, that first visible timestamp is used as the start time. It is difficult to trace back to the disk for a source region, potentially observed as some field line movement off the SW limb around 2024-04-26T13:01Z in SDO AIA 171/193 and GOES SUVI 284.",,343.0,km/s,,16.0,-24.0,0.0,True,2024-04-26 23:00:00+00:00,0,S,,Plane-of-sky,"SOHO: LASCO/C2, SOHO: LASCO/C3, STEREO A: SECCHI/COR2",,2024-04-26,2024,4,26,13,117,2,Normal,False
